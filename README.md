### 🚀 About Me

I'm a driven and disciplined student with a strong background in leadership and critical thinking.  
My experiences have shaped me into someone who thrives under pressure, adapts quickly, and solves complex problems with a clear, focused mindset.

I enjoy understanding how systems work - from low-level computing to modern backend and ML infrastructure.  
Whether building from scratch or optimizing existing code, I approach challenges with curiosity, structure, and a willingness to learn.

📌 I'm currently seeking **Software Engineering Internship** or **Student Developer** roles for 2025.
